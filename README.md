## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript (ES6)

### What I learned

During this project build up I did try different styling that I have not tried before and they include the use of the ::before pseudo-element. 
Finally JavaScript was used to validate email input by user indicating an error message when a wrong email address is inputted by the user.


### Continued development

Still working on the use of Block Element Modifiers method for my naming convention during my web page build up.
